### Summary
   * [OFDM frame generator (MATLAB tutorial)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/OFDM/README.md)
    > This material was prepared as a demonstration of the fact that modeling in MATLAB is not much more complicated than modeling in Simulink.
   * [Channel modeling](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/4328eb389b3ddc9a0c350eaed468f870)
    > This material was prepared to demonstrate how to model simple digital signal transmission over a flat fading channel.
