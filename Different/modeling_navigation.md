Following materials were prepared as an addition to the ["Methods for Modeling and Optimization"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by Dr. S.V. Kozlov. The main idea of this block is to show basic principles of digital systems modeling without GUI. 

### Content:
   * [OFDM frame generator (MATLAB tutorial)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/OFDM/README.md)
    This material was prepared as a demonstration of the fact that modeling in MATLAB is not much more complicated than modeling in Simulink.

   * [Channel modeling (MATLAB tutorial)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/4328eb389b3ddc9a0c350eaed468f870)
    This material was prepared to demonstrate how to model simple digital signal transmission over a flat fading channel.
