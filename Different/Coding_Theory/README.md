Following materials were prepared as an addition to the ["Methods for Modeling and Optimization"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by Dr. S.V. Kozlov. The main idea of this block is to show basic principles of digital systems modeling without GUI. 

* Digital modulation
  * [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kirlf/linear-modulation-schemes) (+ [self-cheking test](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/Coding_Theory/test-2-channel.pdf))

Following materials were prepared by us especially for Module 2 ("Basics of effective and noiseless coding theory
") of ["Theory of the construction of information and communication networks and systems"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by S.S. Sedov.

* Channel coding:
  * [Main principles](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/README.md) (+ [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kirlf/channel-coding-schemes) and [self-cheking test](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/Coding_Theory/test-2-channel.pdf))
  * [Convolutional codes tutorial](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/Convolutional%20codes%20modeling.md)
  * [LDPC codes (python tutorial)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/LDPC.ipynb) 

> We are suggesting you to spend some time for learning of these materials anyway. It may help you to understand faster some of the topics of S.S. Sedov's and [Marko Hennhofer's](http://www5.tu-ilmenau.de/nt/de/private_home/hennhoefer/index.html) courses. Hence, you can spend more time to your **scientific researches**. 
   
  
* Entropy codes:
  * [Huffman codes basics (python tutorial)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/gist/kirlf/2eb242f225f9bfed4ecbfc8e1e2f5f71/Huffman%20codes.ipynb#/)
  
 > Topic is prepared as preparation before [Audio Coding](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/mt/lehrveranstaltungen/lehre-fuer-master-mt/audio-coding/) subject.
  
**Bonus**:

* [Modulation and coding schemes in small satellite systems (short review)](https://github.com/kirlf/cubesats/blob/master/fec.md)
