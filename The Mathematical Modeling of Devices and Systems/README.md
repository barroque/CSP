Hello, everyone!

The materials presented in this block are primarily intended for students of **GRIAT-CSP** \(KNRTU-KAI named after A.Tupolev\). However, everyone can join the discussion, or write to me, if you know how to make these small lessons more interesting and useful. You are welcome!

Tasks aim to train modeling skills without different **GUI**s \(Graphical User Interfaces\), such as **MatLab Simulink**, for example.

The author does not deny that for certain purposes it is more convenient to use the  **Simulink**, however, he is deeply convinced that the solutions made with the help of programming languages are more manageable, faster \(in terms of speed of processing\) and elegant.

Yes, it is your right to consider Simulink as a simpler solution ([*well, nobody is perfect*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYUfPTeE0DM)), but during the course you should to practice your MATLAB and Python programming skills.

So, all the words are said, tune in to a serious mood, let's go!

M.Sc. Vladimir Fadeev
