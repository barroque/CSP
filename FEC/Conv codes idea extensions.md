# Convolutional codes basics

## Summary

## Reed-Solomon Convolutional concatenated (RSCC) codes

Very popular option of the FEC in the satellite communication systems. It relates to the [deep-space communication standartd](https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-63/63H.PDF) that allows to achieve sufficiently high BER performance (fig. 3.2).
