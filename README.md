    * [MIMO in future standards (short review)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Outlloks.md)

II. [Channel coding](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/README.md)
1. 
   * [Modeling of convolutional codes in MatLab](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/Convolutional%20codes%20modeling.md)
   * [Survey of concatenated and Turbo codes](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/Conv%20codes%20idea%20extensions.md)
2. [LDPC codes (with Python example)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/LDPC.ipynb)


1. [OFDM frame generator (MATLAB tutorial)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/tree/master/Different/OFDM)
    
> This material was prepared as a demonstration of the fact that modeling in MATLAB is not much more complicated than modeling in Simulink.

2. [Huffman codes basics (with python example)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/gist/kirlf/2eb242f225f9bfed4ecbfc8e1e2f5f71/Huffman%20codes.ipynb#/)

3. [Convolutional codes basics (with MATLAB examples)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/Convolutional%20codes%20intro.md)

> These materials were prepared by us especially for Module 2 ("Basics of effective and noiseless coding theory
") of ["Theory of the construction of information and communication networks and systems"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by S.S. Sedov.
