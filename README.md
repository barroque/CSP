**Additional teaching materials for the Communication and Signal Processing (CSP) major of German-Russian Institute of Advanced Technologies (GRIAT).** 

1. [MIMO technology](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/README.md)

These materials were preperaded as a feasible help for preparation to the [prof. Martin Haardt's](http://www5.tu-ilmenau.de/nt/en/private_home/haardt/bio/index.html) "MIMO technology" course.
Small lectures with MATLAB and python examples about [Space-Time Codes (Alamouti)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Alamouti.ipynb) and [MIMO channel capacity](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/MIMO%20Capacity.ipynb) can be found via this link. Moreover, topics, such as [Multi-User MIMO](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/BlockDiagonalization.ipynb) and [Spatial correlation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Spatial_Correlation.ipynb), are considered as a self-education issues.

2. [Communication systems modeling](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/modeling_navigation.md)

3. [Coding theory](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/Coding_Theory/README.md)
 
4. [Digital Signal Processing](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/DSP/README.md)

    
**Note that**: 

- Topics about [Huffman codes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/gist/kirlf/2eb242f225f9bfed4ecbfc8e1e2f5f71/Huffman%20codes.ipynb#/) and [Filter banks](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/DSP/FB.md) are prepared as preparation before [Audio Coding](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/mt/lehrveranstaltungen/lehre-fuer-master-mt/audio-coding/) subject.
