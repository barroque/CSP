# Communication and Signal Processing 

Different topics and materials about CSP. 

I. [Channel coding](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/tree/master/FEC)

1. [Convolutional codes](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/Convolutional%20codes%20intro.md)
2. LDPC

II. [MIMO technology](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/README.md)
1. MATLAB tutorials:
    * [Rician flat fading (SISO)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/4328eb389b3ddc9a0c350eaed468f870)
    * [Space-Time Codes (Alamouti)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/9587c6859db08e5e813b0650f97c7344)
2. Python tutorials:

III. Different topics
1. [OFDM frame generator (MATLAB tutorial)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/tree/master/Different/OFDM)
    
This material was prepared as: 
   - self-training in scripts writing;
   - a demonstration of the fact that modeling in MATLAB is not much more complicated than modeling in Simulink.

2. [Adaptive Antenna Arrays (rus)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/1b70de0ef1b9cdf3c00c317920e8d252)
    

This material was prepared as a self-taining in python modeling. The results are the part of the contribution to the [Phased Antenna Arrays(rus)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%88%D1%91%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0)
