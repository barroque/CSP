**Additional teaching materials for the Communication and Signal Processing (CSP) major of German-Russian Institute of Advanced Technologies (GRIAT).** 

1. [MIMO technology](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/README.md)

    > These materials were preperaded as a feasible help for preparation to the [prof. Martin Haardt's](http://www5.tu-ilmenau.de/nt/en/private_home/haardt/bio/index.html) "MIMO technology" course.
Small lectures with MATLAB and python examples about [Space-Time Codes (Alamouti)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Alamouti.ipynb) and [MIMO channel capacity](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/MIMO%20Capacity.ipynb) can be found via this link. Moreover, topics, such as [Multi-User MIMO](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/BlockDiagonalization.ipynb) and [Spatial correlation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Spatial_Correlation.ipynb), are considered as a self-education issues.

2. [Communication systems modeling](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/modeling_navigation.md)
    
   > Following materials were prepared as an addition to the ["Methods for Modeling and Optimization"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by Dr. S.V. Kozlov.

3. [Coding theory](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/Coding_Theory/README.md)
   > Following materials were prepared by us especially for Module 2 ("Basics of effective and noiseless coding theory") of ["Theory of the construction of information and communication networks and systems"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by S.S. Sedov.
 
4. [Digital Signal Processing](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/Different/DSP/README.md)
    > Following materials are prepared by us especially for the ["Advanced Digital Signal Processing"](http://e.kai.ru/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%82%D0%B5/) course by A.A. Korobkov.
