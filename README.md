## Preface

This work is prepared for students of MS-CSP (Communication and Signal Processing) program (GRIAT) primarily. However, everyone who is interested in considered topics is welcome!

### About me and my experience in MIMO

My name is Vladimir Fadeev. I was born in 1993 in Naberezhnye Chelny (Russia), graduated school in 2011 and Bachelor program (with honours) in KNRTU-KAI named after A.N. Tupolev (Communication technologies and Systems - IRET-RTS). In 2015 I entered the Master program in GRIAT (MS-CSP) and received my M.Sc. degree in 2017.

MIMO technology is one of the subjects in 2-nd term of the MS-CSP (GRIAT) program. It was a special honour for us that lecturer is [Dr.-Ing. Martin Haardt](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=h8MtCjsAAAAJ&hl=de) (TU Ilmenau). 

Unfortunately, I was seriously ill during the second part of the course (last 1.5 weeks)... So, I've passed the exam only the second time, frankly speaking.

However, I've decided to solve all of the unclear items that we've considered during the course (at least, for myself). It became my hobby for some time. I've come back to different basic aspects of MIMO technology, again and again, searching answers in **books**, **papers**, **lecture notes** and **discussions with radio engineers**, until the most of basic items became clear for me.

So, you can estimate the results of my specific hobby reading materials of this repository. Hopefully, they are apprehensible and useful.

## Motivation

Why should you learn MIMO technology basics?

MIMO is a part of the **LTE/LTE-A** standard and therefore is used in real mobile networks.

Moreover, the evolution of the MIMO - Massive MIMO is a part of the **5G** networks. This fact means scientific interest, and science is impossible without basics.

Additionally, MIMO topic is a good opportunity to train your **linear algebra** skills!
