# Communication and Signal Processing 

Different topics and materials about CSP. 

I. [MIMO technology](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/README.md)
1. MATLAB tutorials:
    * [Rician flat fading (SISO)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/4328eb389b3ddc9a0c350eaed468f870)
    * [Space-Time Codes (Alamouti)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Alamouti.ipynb)
2. Python tutorials:
    * [MIMO channel capacity](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/MIMO%20Capacity.ipynb)
    * [Multi-User MIMO](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/BlockDiagonalization.ipynb)
3. Self-education:
    * [Spatial correlation (tasks)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Spatial_Correlation.ipynb)
    * [MIMO in future standards (short review)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/MIMO/Outlloks.md)

II. Different topics
1. [OFDM frame generator (MATLAB tutorial)](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/tree/master/Different/OFDM)
    
This material was prepared as: 
   - self-training in scripts writing;
   - a demonstration of the fact that modeling in MATLAB is not much more complicated than modeling in Simulink.
   
2. [Convolutional codes basics](https://github.com/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/Convolutional%20codes%20intro.md)

Basics and MATLAB modelig examples.

3. [LDPC codes (with Python example)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kirlf/CSP/blob/master/FEC/LDPC.ipynb)

This was developed based on my Advanced Research project materials.

4. [Adaptive Antenna Arrays (rus)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kirlf/1b70de0ef1b9cdf3c00c317920e8d252)
    
This material was prepared as a self-training in python modeling.
