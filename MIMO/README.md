# Preface

This work is prepared for students of MS-CSP (Communication and Signal Processing) program (GRIAT) primarily. However, everyone who is interested in considered topics is welcome!

Small information about me:

My name is Vladimir Fadeev, I was born in 1993 in Naberezhnye Chelny (Russia), graduated school in 2011 and Bachelor programm (with honors) in KNRTU-KAI named after A.N. Tupolev (Communication technologies and Systems - IRET-RTS). In 2015 I entered the Master program in GRIAT (MS-CSP) and received my M.Sc. degree in 2017.

MIMO technology is the one of the subjects in 2-nd term and it was special honor for us that lecturer was Dr.-Ing. Martin Haardt (TU Ilmenau). Unfortunatelly, I was seriously ill during the second part of the course (last 1.5 weeks)... So, I've passed exam only the second time and, frankly speaking, with not so high score.

However, I've decided to solve (at least, for myself) all of the unclear items that we've considered during the course. It became my hobby, actually, for some time. I've come back again and again to different basic aspects of MIMO technology, searching answers in books, papers and lecture notes, utill the most of items became clear for me.

So, results of my specific hobby you can estimate reading this repository. Hopefully, they are apprehensible and usefull.

Have a nice reading, good day, nice week and good luck!

M.Sc. Vladimir Fadeev
