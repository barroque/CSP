    "Let us start from the small theory explanation \\[1, p. 11-12\\]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A signal propagating through the wireless channel arrives at the destination along a number of different paths, collectively referred to as multipath. These paths arise from scattering, reflection and diffraction of the radiated energy by objects in the environment or refraction in the medium. The different propagation mechanisms influence path loss and fading models differently. However, for convenience we refer to all these distorting mechanisms as “scattering”. Further, throughout the book, we assume a complex baseband representation for the signal and channel unless otherwise specified.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The signal power drops off due to three effects: mean propagation (path) loss, macroscopic fading and microscopic fading. The mean propagation loss in macrocellular environments comes from inverse square law power loss, absorption by water and foliage and the effect of ground reflection. Mean propagation loss is range dependent.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Macroscopic fading results from a blocking effect by buildings and natural features and is also known as long term fading or shadowing. Microscopic fading results from the constructive and destructive combination of multipaths and is also known as short term fading or fast fading. Multipath propagation results in the spreading of the signal in different dimensions. These are delay spread, Doppler (or frequency) spread (this needs a time-varying multipath channel) and angle spread. These spreads have significant effects on the signal. Mean path loss, macroscopic fading, microscopic fading, delay spread, Doppler spread and angle spread are the main channel effects and are described below.\n",
