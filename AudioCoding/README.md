# Audio Coding

These scripts are the part of the home works of the Audio Coding subject (TU Ilmenau). The structure of the work is described in the [following screenshot](https://yadi.sk/i/tygY2fmt3RU253). Actually, this repository is the act of goodwill. We believe, that these scripts will be useful for someone who is interested in perceptual audio coding issues. We propose to learn more topics about audio coding by [following metherials](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/de/mt/lehrveranstaltungen/lehre-fuer-master-mt/audio-coding/). For home works you should learn lectures 2-6. 

Thank you for your attention and we wish you good luck!

P.S.

We have to inform you about possible bugs:
1) "Pickling" (pickle module) to the binary file may make your file significantly larger than original. It is very tricky, and may be relates to python's data formats. 
2) Writing to the file after Huffman encoding is not completed. We write just a string instead of binary sequence.  

P.S.S.

The most difficult for undersatanding part of the perceptual coding concept is the psychoacoustic.
We suggest the following videos to learn more about this topic: [click here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz-7EFd3_gwFfBdaiNdKeqA/videos).

Nice watching!
